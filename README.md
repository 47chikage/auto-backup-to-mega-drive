# auto-backup-to-mega-drive

## Description
Use this to upload entire folders automatically to your mega cloud

# How to use
Write email,password and folder to upload to in your mega drive (must be existing) separated by skip line in credentials.txt
Write paths of folders to upload in setup.txt separated by skiplines
Run main and press backup
You can also change the paths and credentials in the app by pressing change credentials as long as you dont mess up the structure

# Additional notes
This was done very fast and not tested well but it can be used fairly easily with complete freedom
An exe file can be generated with pyinstaller and can be automatized to run every set period
